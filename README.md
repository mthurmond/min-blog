## Min blog
Share your stories without distractions, ads, or fees. It's a calmer, more enjoyable blogging experience for you and your readers. 

This tool is free and open source. The design was inspired by HEY's [email the world](https://www.hey.com/world/) and the name was inspired by [minbrowser](https://minbrowser.org/). I recommend both. 

I took down the demo and am not maintainging this, but it all works if you want to fork the repo and host it somewhere. If you'd prefer to create a personal blog with the same design checkout [Express Blog](https://github.com/mthurmond/express-blog), my other project.
